	missing.
	- pommed: add support for power_supply class to the ACPI code.

	and remove the KDE beep sound.

version 1.13:
	- pommed: add an option to disable the beep on volume change.
	- pommed: add the videoSwitch DBus notification.
	- wmpomme: add video switch support.
	- gpomme: add video switch support.
	- pommed: add support for LCD backlight control on the Intel 965GM
	found in the MacBook3,1.
	- pommed: rework the inotify code to handle several events at once
	and to handle events with long filenames (longer than

	receiving an inotify event with ie->len > sizeof(struct inotify_event).

version 1.12:
	- pommed: do not expect at least 3 evdevs at startup; there are
	only 2 on the MacBook, and possibly only 1 on the pmac machines.

	- pommed: beep on volume change, now that we have the audio code
	in pommed itself.
	- gpomme: remove audio-related code.
	- pommed: partial support (ie. no LCD backlight yet) for the
	MacBook3,1 (MacBook Core2 Duo Santa Rosa, November 2007).
	- pommed: rework the event management. Use epoll() for event
	polling instead of poll(). Use inotify to watch new event devices
	appear in /dev/input. This effectively fixes our disappearing
	event devices issues after suspend. YAY.
	- pommed: add support for the external Apple USB keyboards, white
	& alu. If you have such a keyboard with another USB ID, please
	contact me. Patch from Carmine 'earcar' Paolino <earcar@gmail.com>.
	- pommed: add secondary locations for the uinput device
	node. Heads up & patch from Carmine 'earcar' Paolino.

version 1.10:
	- pommed: add a beeper feature as a substitute to the missing PC
	Speaker. The feature is disabled by default, as not all machines
	need it and not everybody wants it ;)

version 1.9:
	- pommed: add an idle timer to automatically switch off the
	keyboard backlight. Suggested by Javier Marcet.
	- pommed: turn has_kbd_backlight() into an inline function.
	- pommed: kill code duplication in the main loop.

version 1.8:
	- pommed: probe for the applesmc sysfs path in the ambient light
	handling code. The path has changed in Linux 2.6.22.
	- pommed: added automatic LCD backlight dimming when switching
	from AC to battery power (and vice-versa).
	- pommed: send out DBus notification when the automatic LCD
	backlight dimming kicks in (similar to the automatic keyboard
	backlight notification).
	- gpomme: adjust for the new LCD backlight notification.
	- Add the gpomme icon contributed by Jan Larres
	<jan@majutsushi.net> under the icons/ directory.
	- pommed: add support for the nVidia GeForce 8600M GT found in the
	MacBookPro3,1. I don't like that code, if there's something better
	that can be used, please mail me.

version 1.7:
	- pommed: add partial support for the MacBookPro3,1 (Core2 Duo,
	15" & 17", June 2007). New Apple IR receiver too. Missing nVidia
	backlight control.

version 1.5:
	- pommed: back to using eject(1) for CD ejection.

	detection; it seems some PowerBooks (5,4) do not have a node type
	associated with the node in the device-tree.

version 1.4:
	- pommed: add proper support for the PowerBook5,8 and PowerBook5,9
	(PMU05 machines); add Geyser keyboard identification, PMU05
	ambient light sensors and keyboard backlight. Thanks Gaudenz
	Steilin for the report and testing.
	- pommed: added a simple backlight toggle mode, used when the
	automatic backlight is disabled in the configuration file.
	- pommed: enumerate i2c adapters.

	- gpomme: added elegant-bright and elegant-dark themes, courtesy
	of Natanael Arndt <arndtn@gmx.de>.
	- pommed: rewrote CD ejection routine; no longer depends on eject,
	sends the dbus notification before ejecting the CD.
	- pommed: add DBus methods to control pommed over DBus. Original
	patch by Alexis ROBERT <alexis@fnux.org>.
	- pommed: add keyboard backlight fading for automatic keyboard
	backlight. Based on a patch from Mario Oschwald
	<mario.oschwald@hpi.uni-potsdam.de>.
	- pommed: try harder to reopen the event devices when coming back
	from suspend.

version 1.2:
	- pommed: PowerBook5,5 has an ADB keyboard, not a USB keyboard.
	- Added October 2003 iBook G4 support (PowerBook6,3), patch by

	- wmpomme: adapt to the new DBus notification.
	- pommed: added support for nVidia GPUs.

	If you own one of the machines listed above, please test pommed by
	running pommed -d and tell us:
	   - if it works at all
	   - if, not running either pommed or pbbuttonsd, pressing the
	     backlight up/down keys makes the backlight level change
	Please send the debug output along with these information; we know
	that pommed won't work out of the box on some of these machines.

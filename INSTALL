Installation instructions for pommed
------------------------------------

pommed  - the daemon


Building
--------

pommed requires:
 - pciutils / libpci (on Intel machines only)
 - libofapi aka oflib (PowerMac machines only, see below)
 - zlib
 - libconfuse
 - libasound

For PowerPC machines, if you do not have libofapi installed, can't find it or
do not want to install it, run make pommed OFLIB=1 to use the embedded copy
of libofapi.


Installing
----------

 - copy pommed somewhere in your PATH (/usr/bin)
 - copy pommed/data/* to /usr/share/pommed
 - copy pommed.conf.(mactel|pmac) as /etc/pommed.conf
 - install the pommed.init initscript as /etc/init.d/pommed, make it executable
   and perform any additional configuration needed on your system (links to
   /etc/rc?.d/ for instance)

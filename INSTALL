Installation instructions for pommed

pommed  - the daemon


Building

pommed requires:
 - pciutils / libpci (on Intel machines only)
 - libofapi aka oflib (PowerMac machines only, see below)
 - zlib
 - libconfuse

For PowerPC machines, if you do not have libofapi installed, can't find it or

of libofapi.

 - copy pommed.conf.(mactel|pmac) as /etc/pommed.conf
 - install the pommed.init initscript as /etc/init.d/pommed, make it executable
   and perform any additional configuration needed on your system (links to
   /etc/rc?.d/ for instance)
